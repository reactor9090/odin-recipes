<h2>Description:</h2>

<p>
Start by boiling a pot of water and adding a pinch of salt. Once the water is boiling, add your desired type of pasta and cook it according to the package instructions. While the pasta is cooking, heat a pan with some olive oil. Add finely chopped garlic and sauté until fragrant, then toss in diced tomatoes or tomato sauce. Let it simmer for a few minutes and season with salt, pepper, and your favorite herbs like basil or oregano. If you'd like to add protein, you can mix in cooked chicken, shrimp, or sautéed vegetables. Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and add it to the sauce. Toss everything together, sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese on top, and serve hot. Enjoy!
